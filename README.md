# Text2Canvas

Text2Canvas is an awesome, open source program written in Javascript to make it
easier to use the Piet Programming Language. Namely, to make it easier, it
limits the amount of mouse precision required to properly and quickly code in
Piet by enabling the user to do everything they can do in a normal image editing
program by using text commands. This is not intended to be the textual version
of Piet. Rather, it is simply a way to draw images using text geared toward
programming in Piet. Besides, it's easier just to interpret an image itself.
Yeesh. Feel free to copy the program and modify it as you please.
